This is a monorepo for backend (written in Go) and frontend using React.

When running the AI agent, you need to focus on the context of the subfolder that you are working on.

For example, if I ask to work on the frontend folder, you can only run commands that are specified for that folder and retrieve context for that only.

Do not mix the context of the frontend and the backend.
